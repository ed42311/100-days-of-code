# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 1: 2 Jan 2017

1 hour of code for today and CSS is definitely not my strong suite.  There is something to be proud of here, though:

```
#offline-menu{
  background-color: darkgreen;
  position: fixed;
  display:none;
  height:50px;
  width:2px;
}

#offline-menu-btn:hover > #offline-menu {
  display:initial;
}
```
Haven't looked at the back end stuff yet, but that should be a lot easier, ha!.  First time in a while I haven't used bootstrap to get the styling out of the way.

## Day 2: 3 Jan 2017

Another hour of code, and it was really tough today.  Work is such a pain in the ass right now, I never know what I'm supposed to do, the atmosphere has slowly become less and less supportive, less and less helpful.  At least the weather API is really cool, going to try another code challenge as well, see if I can get past something.  Got the tempature working agian with the clesisu converter, need to wrok on some styling.  CSS agian.

## Day 3: 4 Jan 2017

Cleaned up a few things in the weather app, need to write some tests, see if that is hard to do or not...   I am thinking jasmine right now, but we will see after some experimentation.  Also watched a few basic videos and did a few challenges on codewars.

## Day 6: 10 Jan 2017
Learning to reinstall node agian:

start with homebrew:
1. ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
  - this is a good resource to remember [Treehouse Blog install Node](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/install-node-js-npm-mac)

#  RESTART
*******

## Day 1: 16 Jan 2017
We begin agian with the coding after a restart, things are not always perfect.  Going with some interval projects for when I get stuck on the larger stuff. Found some very simple vanilla JS stuff with Wes Bos at [Javascript30](https://javascript30.com).  Going to use those in the middle of the other projects, also need to do a few code challenges tonight.  

## Day 2: 18 Jan 2017
Working on the javascript clock, got some cool things like ```transition-timing-function``` and how to set a ```transform```

## Day 3: 19 Jan 2017
Learned about CSS Variables which are super awesome.  You have to append -- to the begining of them and you can scop them and then retrieve them from that scope.  Also dataset is the object that contains all the data- varaibles in it, which is pretty cool.  What else, oh yeh mousemove event is also kind of awesome, but I could see it getting out of hand quickly.

## Day 4: 20 Jan 2017
Arraayyyss!  Cool stuff, espc with the arrow functions.  Sort and reduce are still kind of mystifying, how am I kidding, i don't really understand it at all, need to keep using them til I get it.  ```Sort takes a,b```  map always returns the same number of items.
