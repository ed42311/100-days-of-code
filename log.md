# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 1: 1 Jan 2017

**Today's progress**: Forked the [100 Days Of Code repo](https://github.com/Kallaway/100-days-of-code); updated [Log](log.md) and [Rules](rules.md). Also changed the README to link to the [original repo](https://github.com/Kallaway/100-days-of-code).

**Thoughts:** This would be quite a challenge if you'd never used GitHub before. Of course, it's a great chance to learn to use GitHub! At [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/), I’ve completed the Front End Development Certification lessons through “JSON APIs and Ajax” with one exception: “Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage.” Next up: “Intermediate Front End Development Projects."

**Link to work:** “Build a Tribute Page”: [Georgia O’Keeffe, Artist](http://codepen.io/macloo/full/mORjyd/), in which I practiced using Bootstrap. This is a Free Code Camp project.
