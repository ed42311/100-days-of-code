# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 1: 2 Jan 2017

1 hour of code for today and CSS is definitely not my storng suite.  There is something to be proud of here, though:

```
#offline-menu{
  background-color: darkgreen;
  position: fixed;
  display:none;
  height:50px;
  width:2px;
}

#offline-menu-btn:hover > #offline-menu {
  display:initial;
}
```
Haven't looked at the back end stuff yet, but that should be a lot easier, ha!.  First time in a while I haven't used bootstrap to get the styling out of the way.
